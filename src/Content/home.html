    <em>&ldquo;The varsity Sport for the Mind,&rdquo; FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits,teams of 25 students or more are challenged to raise funds, design a team &ldquo;brand,&rdquo; hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as close to &ldquo;real-world engineering&rdquo; as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; FIRST&nbsp;Team #4819, the Flat Mountain Mechanics,
is composed of home-educated students as well as teens from three local school districts.
Our Team Members do not necessarily receive school credit for FIRST; they participate
solely because they enjoy&nbsp;it. To these gifted kids, FIRST is about learning; winning is just a bonus!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Our group&nbsp;was started in December 2012, with Lead Mentor&nbsp;Eric Prewett, 
pushing the buttons to organize a FIRST team for Mt.&nbsp;Pleasant, Michigan. 
He was given the team number #4819 and a grant from&nbsp;JCPenney, 
covering the costs of the initial Kit Of Parts 
(everything needed for building a rolling chassis) and 2 district competition&nbsp;fees. 
After probing for potential&nbsp;students and mentors, 
Mr. Prewett&nbsp;organized intial team meetings.
&nbsp;After just a couple team meetings we had decided upon the team name of&nbsp;<em>Flat Mountain Mechanics</em>, 
as&nbsp;we live in the vicinity of Mt. Pleasant&nbsp;with no mountain&nbsp;in sight.</p>
